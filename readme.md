# Team-Profile-Generator

# Project Description
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
A screenshot showing an example user input is shown below:

As I'm prompted tp answer user questions the application creates an HTML based on the input.

As you can see the profiles were created with the correct ids, names and inputs. I was able to make the email funtional but the github url was not. I will come back at a later date to fix.


I have added a video displaying functionality. I was unable to get the codes to pass all the tests. I kept working with them to get the best results. Which is the code I have.
